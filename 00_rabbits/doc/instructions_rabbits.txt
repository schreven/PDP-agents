The Rabbits Grass simulation

The Rabbits Grass simulation is a simulation of an ecosystem: rabbits wander around randomly on a discrete grid environment on which grass is growing randomly. Rabits have an initial amount of energy and with each move they loose a part of it. Once their energy is 0, they die. But when an alive rabbit bumps into some grass, it eats the grass and gains some energy. If a rabbit gains enough energy, it reproduces. The reproduction takes some energy so the rabbit can not reproduce twice within the same simulation step. The grass can be adjusted to grow at different rates and give the rabbits differing amounts of energy. It has to be possible to fully control the total amount of grass being grown at each simulation step. The model can be used to explore the competitive advantages of these variables.

This model has been described at http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/RabbitsGrassWeeds for the NetLogo simulation toolkit.

You have to program the Rabbits Grass Simulation in RePast, using the following requirements:

    Grid : the size of the world should be changeable. The default is a 20x20 grid. The world has no borders on the edges (thus, it is a torus).
    Collisions : different rabbits cannot stay on the same cell.
    Legal moves : only one-step moves to adjacent cells (north, south, east and west) are allowed.
    Eat condition : a rabbit can eat grass when it occupies the same cell.
    Communication : we assume that agents can not communicate with one another.
    Visible range and directions : all rabbits are blind and move randomly.
    Creation: at their births, rabbits are created at random places.

Implement sliders for the following variables of the simulation:

    Grid size
    The number of rabbits defines the initial number of rabbits
    The birth threshold of rabbits defines the energy level at which the rabbit reproduces.
    The grass growth rate controls the rate at which grass grows (total amount of grass added to the whole world within one simulation tick).

Create a population plot to observe the evolution of the rabbits and the grass.


1.	Rename the folder lastname1-lastname2-in.
2.	Import the project in Eclipse (or another IDE, for example Netbeans).
3.	Reference the library repast.
4.	Other libraries such as colt.jar and plot.jar might be needed, so you can reference them as well. They can be downloaded on moodle (Additional JAR libraries for the programming exercises).
5.	Link the javadoc for the repast library which can be found on moodle (Repast javadoc).
6.	Write your code in RabbitsGrassSimulationAgent, RabbitsGrassSimulationModel and RabbitsGrassSimulationSpace (do not rename these files and do not put them into packages!).
7.	Run the simulation by running MainRabbit.java.
8.	Make sure that you fulfill the requirements for the solution given in the exercise description.
9.	Write documentation using the latex template and place it into the doc folder. The pdf should be named lastname1-lastname2-in.pdf.
10.	Create a runnable jar file and place it in the folder lastname1-lastname2-in.
11.	Zip the folder lastname1-lastname2-in (without the libraries) and submit it on moodle.
